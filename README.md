# Passive CSI collection

Fork of StevenMHernandez's [Passive CSI Tool](https://github.com/StevenMHernandez/ESP32-CSI-Tool)

Listens passively for packets on a given channel. This channel can be changed in `main/main.c` depending on the channel of the device you wish to passively listen for.

To use run `make flash monitor` from a terminal.
